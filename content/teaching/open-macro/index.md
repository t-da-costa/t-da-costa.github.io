Tutorials on the Mundell-Fleming model, at [Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne](https://www.pantheonsorbonne.fr/). I was a teaching assistant (TA) to [Delphine Brochard](https://www.pantheonsorbonne.fr/page-perso/Delphine.Brochard@), 12 hours.

## Course outline
The aim of the course is to **analyze the impact of opening up trade with the rest of the world**, both on macroeconomic equilibrium conditions and on the potential effectiveness of fiscal, monetary and exchange rate policies. Analytically, the course is based on the IS/LM model in an open economy (Mundell-Fleming model).

1. Analytical framework.
2. Equilibrium conditions.
3. Effect of fiscal policy.
4. Effect of monetary policy & devaluation.
5. A model with two large, interdependent countries.
6. Effect of exchange rate policy.
