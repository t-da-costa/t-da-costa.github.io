abstract: Optimistically biased belief updating is essential for mental health and resilience in adversity. Here, we asked how experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic affected optimism biases in updating beliefs about the future. One hundred and twenty-three participants estimated the risks of experiencing adverse future life events in the face of belief-disconfirming evidence either outside the pandemic (n = 58) or during the pandemic (n = 65). While belief updating was optimistically biased and Reinforcement-learning-like outside the pandemic, the bias faded, and belief updating became more rational Bayesian-like during the pandemic. This malleability of anticipating the future during the COVID-19 pandemic was further underpinned by a lower integration of positive belief-disconfirming information, fewer but stronger negative estimations, and more confidence in base rates. The findings offer a window into the putative cognitive mechanisms of belief updating during the COVID-19 pandemic, driven more by quantifying the uncertainty of the future than by the motivational salience of optimistic outlooks.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: I studied how experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic affected optimism biases in updating beliefs about the future. During COVID-19, people experienced a significant decrease in belief updating following good news and a switch in how they update their belief from Reinforcement Learning to a Bayesian approach.
