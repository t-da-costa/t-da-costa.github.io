I studied an alternative to current refrigeration machines: elastocaloric cooling, induced by the application of stress on an elastomeric material. This work was based on theoretical considerations and a reference prototype, by considering the conformations of monomer chains to predict the behavior of rubber bands. A series of experiments were set up to determine which rubber band would exhibit the greatest temperature variation to maximize the efficiency of our prototype.
