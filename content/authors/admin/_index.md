#    summary: |
#      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#      Learned:
#      - Synthesize your own blockchain solutions
#      - Gain an in-depth understanding of the specific mechanics of Bitcoin
#      - Understand Bitcoin’s real-life applications and learn how to attack and destroy Bitcoin, Ethereum, smart contracts and Dapps, and alternatives to Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm

#    summary: |
#      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## Welcome on this page!

<p align="justify">
I am currently a <strong>visiting research student</strong> in the <a href="https://slevin.princeton.edu/">Levin Lab</a>, at <strong>Princeton University</strong>, as a <a href="https://gradschool.princeton.edu/admission-onboarding/nondegree-programs/visiting-students/procter-visiting-fellowships">Jane Eliza Procter Fellow</a>.
</p>

<p align="justify">
I have an interdisciplinary background, ranging from <strong>physics</strong> and
<strong>mechanics</strong> (BSc.) to <strong>economics</strong> and <strong>cognitive sciences</strong> (MSc.). My research interests build on this diversity and include dynamic macroeconomics or various topics in ecological economics, notably methods to integrate biodiversity and strong durability into models. I am also interested in boundedness in behavioral economics and uncertainty in modelling.
