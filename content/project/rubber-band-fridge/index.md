I studied an alternative to current refrigeration machines: elastocaloric cooling, induced by the application of stress on an elastomeric material. Based on theoretical considerations and a reference prototype, an entropic study based on the conformations of monomer chains aimed to predict the behavior of rubber bands. A series of experiments were set up to determine which rubber band would exhibit the greatest temperature variation.
